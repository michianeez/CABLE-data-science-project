## Set Up

**Loading packages and read in data**
```{r}
library(tidyverse)s
library(broom)

mentalhealth <- read.csv("Toth_Faherty_Mazaheri_Raymond_data.csv")
```

Note: Checked the DASS-21 questionnaire; no reverse coding needed. 

**Demographics**
```{r}
mentalhealth %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  count()

# same as the pre-print
```

**Wrangling**
```{r}
spmentalhealth <- mentalhealth %>% 
  gather(Question, Response, Question.1:Question.21) %>% 
  mutate(gender = dplyr::recode(gender, "N/A" = "Unknown", "Other" = "Unknown"))
```

**Summed DASS-21 Score**
```{r}
# summed DASS-21 score of each ppts
sumdass <- spmentalhealth %>% group_by(pp.number) %>% summarise(sumdass = sum(Response))

#all ppt demo details + summed DASS-21 score
pinfo <- inner_join(sumdass, mentalhealth) %>% select(pp.number, age, gender, year, sumdass)
```
